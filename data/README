idea: separate data from source code.
"raw" contains .zips as delivered by Florians package. Only into this directory we should copy things manually.
"prepared" contains the processed data s.t. it is ready to use in training (e.g. prepared input, small npzs, ...) 
The contents of this directory will be automatically generated from the contents of the "raw" directory. The scripts doing so should be in src/data_preparation/
